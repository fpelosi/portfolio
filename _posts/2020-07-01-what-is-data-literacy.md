## Why data literacy is important and how can organizations overcome a gap in understanding information

Every day, businesses grow more data dependent. As applications become more sophisticated and information becomes more accessible, businesses are able to use data to make better decisions.

Although there has been a big improvement in recent years, there is still a significant gap in data literacy. In fact, [50% of organizations lack sufficient data literacy skills](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/a-data-and-analytics-leaders-guide-to-data-literacy/) to achieve business value. This means that although the data is available, organizations are unable to read it, interpret it, and use it to its full potential because of a gap in understanding.

For companies to flow internally and use the data at their disposal to grow, there has to be an organizational culture that values data literacy and requires that employees have at least a basic understanding of it. Here is a breakdown of what data literacy is and how companies can overcome the gap holding them back.

## What is data literacy?

According to Gartner, data literacy is:

> “The ability to read, write, and communicate data in context, including an understanding of data sources and constructs, analytical methods, and techniques applied — and the ability to describe the use case, application, and resulting value.”
> 
> Gartner

Essentially, data literacy is the ability to take the data from your various sources and tell a story. Can you put data into context and paint a picture for others as to why it’s important? Do you understand what impacts the data? Do you understand the measurement values, and can you communicate effectively using those terms?

These are some of the questions you can ask yourself to get a sense of your data literacy skills. If you avoid data and reports because you get too overwhelmed and confused, your skillset could probably use some strengthening.

## The data literacy gap

There doesn’t seem to be any doubt that data is important fuel for any business. But there is a significant gap in people’s ability to put this data to good use. [75% of key business decision-makers](https://thedataliteracyproject.org/assessment) are not confident in their ability to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data. Data is supposed to help you make better business decisions, not act as a speed bump. Unfortunately, it’s ranked as the second-biggest internal roadblock to the success of chief data officers.

Without data literacy, businesses are leaving a lot on the table. It’s that simple. If you prioritize data literacy company-wide, it will make everyone’s lives easier. Departments can work more in tandem with one another, communication will improve, and operations will be more efficient because everyone can move forward at the same pace.

## How to overcome the data literacy gap

Overcoming the data literacy gap may be easier for larger organizations with a dedicated IT department and Chief Information Officer. Small businesses, on the other hand, will have to figure out a way to train and learn with the resources available to them. Here are some ways you can work to bridge the gap between complete illiteracy and total data domination.

### Figure out your starting point

As with any business strategy, in order to measure success, you have to establish a baseline. Overall, does your business make decisions based on hard data? Are marketing plans and proposals supported by hard information? Do employees communicate frequently with data, and can they interpret it correctly to tell a larger story?

You may have a couple of ‘data nerds’ on the team who immediately come to mind, but it’s probably hard to gauge where many others stand. [The Data Literacy Project](https://thedataliteracyproject.org/assessment) has a very simple assessment that employees can take to give you an idea of their baseline skillset. It’s also advisable to meet with teams to understand how they use data or what they would like to be able to do with data if they had a better understanding.

### Nominate an internal data expert

An internal data expert is the kingpin to your data literacy improvement. This is someone who champions the use of data on a daily basis. They can serve as a staff resource for those who have questions or ideas and can help with training along the way.

### Develop data literacy training

Once you’ve established the biggest data literacy gaps within each department and among the tools they’re using, you can create a training program aimed at addressing these particular issues. Cross training employees is ideal to avoid siloing and promote inter-departmental collaboration.

The Data Literacy Project has a [large portfolio of e-learning classes](https://thedataliteracyproject.org/learn) that span from basic data analytics to more advanced techniques. As you identify which level of data literacy your employees have and where you’d like them to go, you can set them on the best path.

Part of this training should also include platform-specific analytics. Most applications of any size have an educational library of videos, tutorials, and resources for users to take advantage of. Have employees review these materials so they can better understand the tools at their disposal.

### Set your team up for success with the right tools

Yes, everyone should have a basic understanding of data analytics, but obtaining that data should be as simple as possible. Choosing the right tools that present data in a consumable way is critical so employees can get the information they need quickly. Integrating your data solutions tool with key applications is ideal to create one source of truth that produces information based on real-time tasks.

### Create a culture of data

The only way to truly improve data literacy is through exposure, and there is no better way to do that than to embed it into the culture. The simplest way to do this is ensure that all decisions and proposals moving forward are informed by data. Have regular meetings where each department gives a status update using analytics and data to tell the bigger story of what their team has been up to since everyone last met.

Most importantly, leadership has to be on board or data literacy will never improve. Those at the top of the organization not only have to use it themselves but set clear expectations for everyone else that decisions based on data are the new norm. 

## Bring analytics to your small business

You cannot do a one-time training and expect your employees to have advanced analytics capabilities. Improving data literacy requires continuous effort, so regular training and testing will be very crucial to upskilling your team.

Oftentimes, employees struggle with data because everything is siloed. It’s hard to put data into context and tell a bigger story when you have to consult five different sources just to make sense of one statistic.
