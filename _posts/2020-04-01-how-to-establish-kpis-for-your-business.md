## How to set SMART goals and KPIs to accurately evaluate performance 

It’s no secret that establishing goals is vital to your business’ success. You have to set your sights on something that inspires you to produce results and move the needle forward. But setting meaningful goals is completely different, and it’s often easier said than done.

Increasing customer satisfaction, for example, is a great goal every business should strive for. What does that really mean, though? And how will you know when customer satisfaction has increased? 

Many businesses fall prey to these generic goals, thinking that it’s enough to know whether their organization is succeeding or not. Unfortunately, that’s just not the case. Goals need more of a structure to be truly useful. The goals you set should be strategic and informed with real data that matters to your business.

That’s where Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) come into play. KPIs are types of measurements that you can use to determine the success or failure of a particular activity. They are the framework that holds your goals together.

Unlike goals, KPIs can be much harder to create. How do you know which metrics to measure, how to measure them, and how to use that information to make business decisions? It’s easy to get lost in the weeds, especially if your business is looking to establish KPIs for the first time.

Let’s take it back to basics to determine what exactly KPIs are and how to choose the best ones for your business.

## What are KPIs?

At their very core, [KPIs are markers of progress](https://kpi.org/KPI-Basics). As you develop business strategies and goals, you need KPIs to build a framework and bring those strategies and goals into reality.

There are several different types of KPIs that measure different attributes of your business:

- **Input** KPIs measure the resources needed to produce your product or service. Materials and labor hours are common metrics included here.
- **Process** KPIs measure the efficiency and performance of your processes. This could include machinery, software, assembly, and a host of other factors depending on your business.
- **Output** KPIs focus on the quality and consistency of the product or service that is produced. 
- **Outcome** KPIs are the most common as they measure the impact of your outputs. This includes things like sales, customer satisfaction, and retention.
- **Project** KPIs measure the progress of certain initiatives. If you are running a marketing campaign on a new product, these are the metrics you would use to track the success of the campaign and make decisions about how to move forward.
- [**Leading** KPIs](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-kpis) measure and predict future performance. They center around factors like percentage growth in a new market, brand awareness, and trends in an effort to predict the likelihood of achieving a future goal.
- **Lagging** KPIs measure past output. Revenue, number of new customers, and website visitors are common examples. These KPIs are useful in measuring results, but they do focus primarily on outputs. In order to have a more well-rounded KPI set, you’ll need to include leading indicators as well.

Many businesses choose to track KPIs in each of these categories to one degree or another. Determining your own indicators completely relies on your type of business and what you deem to be the most important measurements of success.

## How to establish KPIs for your business

Now that you understand what KPIs are, the next logical question is, which ones should you use for your business specifically? Unfortunately, there’s no definitive answer as every company should tailor their goals and reporting to their own needs. However, you can create effective goals with KPIs based on the [SMART method](https://www.grosvenor.com.au/resources/be-smart-how-to-define-kpis-that-drive-better-results/).

### Specific

Your goals need to be specific so that your KPIs can accurately measure what you’re trying to achieve. As we said before, simply saying you want to increase customer satisfaction is not enough. What do you want to increase, and how much are you going to increase it by? A better goal would be; _We want to increase our average Google Business rating from 4.3 to 4.5 over the next six months._

Meet with your team to determine and define what the goals are. Be detailed and specific. Leaving things up to assumption will only create confusion down the road. 

### Measurable

KPIs won’t do you much good if the goal you’re setting isn’t measurable. Otherwise, how will you know when you’ve succeeded or failed? Every goal should have a metric attached that indicates progress. You should also discuss how you’re going to measure this KPI, the frequency with which you’re going to do so, and how that data will be reported. 

### Attainable

Setting lofty goals is admirable, but if they’re not realistic, then you are setting yourself up for failure. This increases frustration in your organization and definitely tanks morale. Consider the resources at your disposal and whether that coincides with a likely chance of success.

### Results-oriented

You can set goals and establish KPIs for whatever you deem necessary. Make sure though, that you are focusing some of your reporting efforts on results or outputs. If all of your focus is on inputs, you’ll be missing a lot of information.

### Time based

Comparing performance across certain periods of time is the only way to measure success. Give your goals a deadline, so you know what the target is and can set that as a benchmark.

## How will you report performance?

Having KPIs is critical when evaluating the performance of your business. These indicators provide historical data, future predictions, and company-wide assessment of your operation.

In order for your goals and KPIs to reach their maximum effectiveness, your reporting tools need to be connected and streamlined. Measurement methods for different KPIs may not always be the same. One KPI may have information stored in a piece of marketing software, while another KPI has information in the sales program. This leads to multiple systems with different administrators, a lot of manual report-compiling work, and even more frustration. It can cause your company more time and money than the reporting is worth.

If you’re going to invest the time into establishing goals and KPIs, you should ensure your reporting tools are as efficient as possible. Automate your reporting across your business, so you no longer have to spend the time manually gathering data and compiling reports.
