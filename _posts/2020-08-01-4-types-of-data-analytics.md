excerpt: Data analytics is crucial for business success, offering insights through descriptive analytics (answering "what happened"), diagnostic analytics (explaining "why" events occurred), predictive analytics (forecasting "what is likely to happen"), and prescriptive analytics (suggesting "what should I do"). Understanding the distinct roles of these analytics types empowers businesses to make informed decisions and optimize operations.

## Understanding the types of data analytics and the questions they can help you answer as a small business

Data analytics is key to the success of any enterprise, large or small. But what makes it valuable is not the raw numbers and information, it’s the story the data can tell and the questions it can answer.

To incorporate analytics on such a level requires an understanding and appreciation of the various types of information available to you. Unfortunately, on average, between [60 and 73% of all data](https://www.inc.com/jeff-barrett/misusing-data-could-be-costing-your-business-heres-how.html) within an organization goes unused for analytics, which could include critical customer insights, sales trends, and predictions to help future decisions. 

In order to truly harness the power of data analytics, you have to understand what the pieces of the puzzle are and how they all fit together to work for your business. Here are the four types of analytics, their strengths, and the questions they can help you answer.

## Descriptive analytics

Descriptive analytics are usually viewed as the most basic form of analytics and the one used most often by most organizations. [This data answers the questions _what happened?_](https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/4-types-of-data-analytics) or _what is happening?_ 

Descriptive analytics are used to form the foundation. They tell you how key elements of the business are doing and how various tools and efforts are performing. Examples include social media metrics such as followers and likes, Google Analytics data such as web page views and session duration, or sales information such as products sold.

While this data is critical to the overall understanding of business performance, it is not recommended to use descriptive analytics as the basis for any major decisions. The reason being that it doesn’t answer the question of _why?_ Descriptive analytics will tell you that a landing page on your website is getting more traffic than last month, but you need more information to understand why the numbers are increasing.

## Diagnostic analytics

Diagnostic analytics seeks to answer that very question, telling you the exact cause of the problem or the success. This is usually achieved by comparing data against other sets of data and using filters to analyze the information over certain periods of time to identify patterns and key events.

Processes such as [data discovery, data mining, and drill down and drill through](https://www.logianalytics.com/predictive-analytics/comparing-descriptive-predictive-prescriptive-and-diagnostic-analytics/) helps you understand why that landing page is attracting so much more traffic compared to last month or why certain product sales have dipped. 

While diagnostic analytics can tell you why something happened the way it did, it’s still not ideal for making effective decisions or predicting future outcomes. You have to keep climbing the ladder.

## Predictive analytics

Predictive analytics answers the question _what is likely to happen_? As the name implies, it uses descriptive and diagnostic data to predict future outcomes such as what is going to happen and when it’s going to happen. [Models and machine learning processes analyze the data](https://www.dezyre.com/article/types-of-analytics-descriptive-predictive-prescriptive-analytics/209) to identify patterns and exceptions then fill in the gaps with best possible guesses to provide predictions.

As of 2018, only [23% of businesses were using predictive analytics](https://www.business2community.com/strategy/predictive-analytics-in-2018-whats-possible-whos-doing-it-and-how-02127016#:~:text=So%20how%20many%20businesses%20are,unchanged%20from%20the%20prior%20year.) despite most of them showing interest. Resources and budget are often the two biggest hurdles companies face in implementing it as there are usually two avenues; purchasing software and doing it in-house or hiring an outside vendor to do it for you.

Businesses can use predictive analytics to choose which marketing ad will be most successful, which leads are more likely to convert, which products will sell faster, and more. Large retailers such as Amazon use predictive analytics to determine future customer behavior and possible inventory shortages to prepare for product orders. Credit scores are also another common example of this type of analytics as banks use past financial data to predict the future likelihood of someone paying their bills on time.

## Prescriptive analytics

Prescriptive analytics answers the question _what should I do?_ This is the ultimate step in business decision making as prescriptive analytics takes the aggregate information from descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics to identify the best possible course of action - similar to a doctor writing you a prescription based on historical data and trends.

According to Gartner, only [3% of businesses are using prescriptive analytics](https://www.dataversity.net/prescriptive-analytics-use-cases/#:~:text=According%20to%20Prescriptive%20Analytics%20Takes,actively%20using%20predictive%20analytics%20tools.). Due to the sophisticated nature of this type of analytics and the technology needed to implement it, many businesses are unable to dedicate time and budget to the necessary tools. Machine learning and business algorithms are needed to continually process and update prescriptive analytics, in addition to the time and effort needed to maintain them.

A common example of prescriptive analytics is Google Maps, which uses a combination of GPS, real-time traffic data, and historical traffic data to find the best route home. Self-driving cars are another prescriptive technology that uses constant input and feedback to identify patterns and make decisions on the best possible outcomes.
