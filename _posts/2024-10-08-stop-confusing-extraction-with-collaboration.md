excerpt: In an ideal workplace, collaboration among colleagues should be mutually beneficial, fostering cooperation, shared goals, and collective problem-solving. However, many corporate environments mislabel one-sided extractions of time, skills, or emotional labor as "collaboration." This creates an imbalance, leaving some employees feeling overworked and underappreciated while others take advantage of the situation. True collaboration benefits everyone involved, but mistaking extraction for teamwork can lead to burnout, resentment, and fractured relationships.

In an ideal workplace, collaboration among colleagues should be mutually beneficial, fostering cooperation, shared goals, and collective problem-solving. However, many corporate environments mislabel one-sided extractions of time, skills, or emotional labor as "collaboration." This creates an imbalance, leaving some employees feeling overworked and underappreciated while others take advantage of the situation. True collaboration benefits everyone involved, but mistaking extraction for teamwork can lead to burnout, resentment, and fractured relationships.

# Understanding the Differences

## What is Extraction?

Extraction in the workplace occurs when one person or group unfairly takes value, effort, or resources from another without proper reciprocation, often disguised as collaboration. In this scenario, one party benefits disproportionately, while the other does most of the work or bears the burden with little recognition. Ultimately, extraction is exploitative, draining time, energy, or credit from one party—contrasting sharply with true collaboration, where value and responsibilities are shared equally.

## What is Collaboration?

Collaboration is about working together toward a shared goal through active participation, mutual respect, and an equitable exchange of ideas and effort. In a healthy collaborative environment, everyone contributes their unique strengths while benefiting from others' input. This balance fosters innovation, enhances problem-solving, and yields stronger results by harnessing the collective strengths of the team.

# The Impact of Peer-Level Extraction

## Erosion of Trust Among Colleagues

When extraction happens regularly among peers, it damages trust. Those being extracted from start to feel used, and this imbalance can lead to bitterness and passive-aggressive behavior. Team dynamics deteriorate when individuals no longer feel they’re in an equitable relationship, leading to disengagement or even open conflict.

## Burnout and Resentment

Extraction is a fast track to burnout, especially for those who feel they are giving much more than they are receiving. Over time, the burdened employee will likely become less motivated, less productive, and more inclined to withdraw from future collaborations. This not only harms the individual but also negatively impacts the team, as resentment festers and the collaborative spirit fades.

## Stifled Growth and Learning

When one person consistently handles specific tasks, their peers miss out on valuable learning opportunities. This creates a skills gap, where only one individual becomes proficient while others lag behind. Genuine collaboration requires shared learning, but extraction keeps some employees stuck in their comfort zones, hindering their growth.

# How to Foster Genuine Peer Collaboration

### Establish Clear Expectations and Roles

To prevent an unequal workload, it’s crucial to set clear expectations at the start of any team project. Everyone should know their responsibilities and how their contributions fit into the bigger picture. A fair division of labor is the foundation for true collaboration.

_Actionable Tip_: Kick off each project with a meeting where team members define their roles and agree on task division. Management should consistently monitor progress and hold employees accountable for fulfilling their responsibilities.

## Openly Recognize Contributions

Actively recognizing and crediting the work of others is one of the simplest ways to foster true collaboration. Make it a habit to give credit where it’s due, both publicly and privately. This acknowledgment builds trust and encourages everyone to contribute fully.

_Actionable Tip_: During meetings or email updates, take time to highlight each team member’s contributions. This small gesture can significantly enhance how valued people feel.

## Rotate Responsibilities and Encourage Skill Sharing

Rather than relying on the same individuals for specific tasks, rotate responsibilities to ensure everyone has the chance to grow. This approach not only evens the workload but also encourages skill development, preventing over-reliance on any single individual.

_Actionable Tip_: Create a skill-sharing initiative where team members can teach one another key skills. Additionally, rotate roles within projects to ensure everyone gets a chance to take on different responsibilities.

## Have Honest Conversations About Boundaries

Healthy collaboration respects personal boundaries. Whether it’s about work hours, workloads, or emotional support, open discussions about boundaries ensure that no one feels overworked or taken advantage of.

_Actionable Tip_: Cultivate a culture where employees feel safe expressing their needs and setting limits without fear of repercussions. For instance, establish norms around after-hours communication and ensure everyone respects one another’s boundaries.

# Redefining Collaboration

True collaboration is rooted in shared effort, mutual respect, and collective success—not extraction. By clarifying roles, recognizing contributions, sharing skills, and respecting boundaries, you can cultivate healthier, more equitable workplace dynamics. Reflect on your own work relationships: are you genuinely collaborating, or might you be taking more than you give?

Take a moment to assess your peer relationships and consider how you can foster healthier, more collaborative dynamics in your workplace.
