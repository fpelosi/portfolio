excerpt: I often find myself in a position where I feel the need for more information to solve a problem, and others have already moved on to finding solutions. I sense that people are quick to jump to solutions, but it could just be the analyst in me preferring to delve deeper into the problem. I frequently participate in discovery sessions intended to understand the problem, and I notice that conversations tend to gravitate towards technical solutions and how we can get things done quickly. People seem to value discussions around solutions more than a deep understanding of the problem.

# The Temptation to Solution
Earlier in my career, I hesitated to speak up in meetings. Initially, I felt that if I asked questions, people would assume I didn't understand. Now, I tend to ask a lot of questions even when I'm confident I already know the answer. I do this because it helps me align my expectations with those I’m speaking to without forcing my assumptions on them.

Having experienced both perspectives, it's reasonable to think that people jump to solutions to show they understand the problem, are actively contributing, and are adding value to the conversation. However, it's important to balance eagerness with a deep understanding of the problems at hand.

# Valuing Speed Over Depth  
The eagerness to find solutions may stem from the tendency organizations have to emphasize speed in decision-making. You've heard the old adage a million times: "time is money." I've seen "speed to market" reflected in matrices that explain business value.

A co-worker and I often talk about "speed," and she always reminds me, "If you want work done quickly, it will either be poorly done or very expensive." In most cases, the outcome is poorly done work. Focusing on "speed to market" and asking the question, "How can we add business value right now?" during the discovery process leads to solutions that may not be sustainably built for the future needs of the organization. In turn, you risk neglecting in-depth comprehension in the pursuit of efficiency. This is why it’s critical to understand what the future needs might be.

# Building for the Future
Solutions that endure over time provide a better customer experience and likely save the organization money in the long term. Constantly rebuilding data environments is expensive and time-consuming. We need to stress the importance of investing in a thorough understanding of problems to build scalable, adaptable solutions.  
Organizations and leadership should reward employees for their contributions to understanding problems, rather than for offering solutions to ill-defined issues.
