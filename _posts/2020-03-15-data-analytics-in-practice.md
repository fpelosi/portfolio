## Three common applications of data analytics for small businesses

This post aims to tackle three important questions:

- What are data analytics?
- How do small businesses realistically use data analytics to improve their operations?
- What are some real life use cases of data analytics in practice?

Our goal is to demystify data analytics and make them an approachable tool for any small business to use. We’ll do this by breaking down three common applications of data analytics that can be used on a daily basis to streamline processes, gain greater insight into operations, and more accurately predict future outcomes.

## How Data Analytics Can Make a Difference

Data analytics is the process of exploring the data your business generates on a daily basis to identify patterns, opportunities, and holes. This includes finances, marketing, operations, and much more.

Knowledge is power for small businesses. Limited resources and smaller staff make it all the more important for teams to have access to data quickly. The success of the business depends on your ability to make well-informed decisions with accurate and current information.

Accessibility and simplicity are also vital components to any data analytics experience. Having all of this information doesn’t mean much if the systems administrator is the only one with access or the only one with enough experience to make sense of the data. Having a user-friendly data solution gives your team the power to operate cohesively.

## Application 1: Financial Analysis and Planning

Data analytics puts the power of financial analysis and planning directly into your hands. Information you thought may have only been accessible through highly advanced software and and financial experts is now at your fingertips.

Eliminate the manual work involved in compiling reports from various resources by using one centralized application. It can give you deep insight into things like cash-flow, break-even, and forecasting so you can make more informed decisions to reduce cost and drive growth.

Even the most technologically challenged people on your staff are able to pull reports and analyze financial data easily. This empowers everyone to improve their financial decision making, which makes the overall company much more efficient.

## Application 2: Expense Management and Cost Reduction

It’s difficult to know the real cost of doing business or fully understand certain aspects of your operations when your sources of data are separated. A cohesive set of data analytics allows you to identify opportunities for process improvement and cost reduction.

Manage your procurement, purchasing, and fulfillment processes more actively with analytics that give you the ability to monitor everything from spending and payments to balances and contract status. You no longer have to work off of questionable data that is gathered and cross checked manually.

Utilizing data analytics will also reduce overall operational costs. By compiling all of your data into one centralized and intuitive platform, you can easily identify redundant spending, errors in pricing, and opportunities to streamline operations.

Ultimately, managing expenses and reducing costs are natural side effects of having the power to make better and faster decisions with data analytics.

## Application 3: Sales and Product Performance Analysis

Data analytics bring your sales, marketing, operations, and finance efforts together so you can understand the big picture instead of having each department operate in its own silo.

Sales teams benefit from having a fully functioning sales funnel, which helps them manage leads and customers more efficiently. Analytics help them forecast potential opportunities and sales as well as keep track of information on target markets, competition, and various stages of the sales journey.

Data analytics also give marketing teams insight into customer behaviors and buying patterns so they can create targeted efforts with improved conversion rates. The more information your business has on its customers, the more it will be able to personalize and optimize their experience.

Product performance analytics are very beneficial for operations and purchasing as well. Having access to robust sales and production information helps your business plan more accurately and predict future orders, which significantly decreases bottlenecks due to last minute decision making.

## Make the Most of Your Business’ Data Analytics

Walk yourself through a three step process to get all the way from planning and implementation to full usage of your data analytics tools:

- **Discovery & Strategy**: Collaborate with your personnel to review existing processes, data sources, and your company’s required reporting efforts. Then build an analytics strategy to automate reporting and help you measure the KPIs that matter most to your operation. 
- **Conversion**: Automate your existing reporting efforts to save on labor hours that are dedicated to manual and repetitive tasks.
- **Enhance**: Using the business models you prepared, transform your spreadsheets and PDFs into an ecosystem of interactive dashboards. Discover insights in your data that tell a story about the health of your company and uncover gaps in your existing analytics strategy.
