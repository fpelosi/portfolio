## How data improves decision-making

Data is much more than a set of numbers and information, or at least it should be. It’s meant to tell a story with context and meaning, connecting various points together to paint a complete picture.

One of the methods of structuring and utilizing data is known as the DIKW (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom) pyramid. Every step of the pyramid requires answers and meaning in order to move up to the next step. Data and information are the building blocks of this pyramid, but knowledge and wisdom require greater insights. 

Unfortunately, many small businesses stop at the data and information levels, never really understanding how to make the most out of their analytics or use them to grow. Let’s break down each level of the pyramid and find out how data should be used to make decisions.

## DIKW Pyramid

The first mention of the [pyramid on record](https://hbr.org/2010/02/data-is-to-info-as-info-is-not) is from T.S. Eliot’s 1934 poem _The Rock_:

> _Where is the Life we have lost in living? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in the information?_
> 
> T.S. Eliot _The Rock_

The pyramid as we’ve come to know it today was first presented by Russell Ackoff in 1989 at a meeting for the International Society for General Systems Research. It is meant to demonstrate a hierarchy between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.

There are versions of the pyramid with different levels. Some even depict it as a chain. Regardless of the visual, the idea is the same. The more meaning data is given, the more valuable it becomes.

## Data

[Data takes the form of unedited and unprocessed numbers](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/dikw-pyramid/), symbols, or characters. It could be server logs, identification information, time stamps, or anything in between. There is no meaning behind it when viewed by itself.

## Information

[Information is data that has been cleaned, organized, and classified](https://towardsdatascience.com/rootstrap-dikw-model-32cef9ae6dfb). This is where data starts to take on shape and meaning, allowing users to identify connections among the data points. Information usually answers questions such as who, what, where, and when.

## Knowledge

The jump to knowledge is often more difficult than the jump to information. Knowledge allows users to answer the ‘how’ questions. How is this information relevant to our business and our goals? How do we use this data to make better and faster decisions? How is this piece of information connected to that piece, and how do they influence one another?

The [knowledge level of the pyramid is where you will start to see patterns](https://towardsdatascience.com/rootstrap-dikw-model-32cef9ae6dfb), which allow you to predict certain outcomes and behaviors. This can help you be proactive as a business and plan your efforts far in advance as opposed to being reactionary. Knowledge is what gives you the leg up on your competitors as it allows you to analyze your data with much greater meaning.

## Wisdom

Wisdom is the most difficult of the four pyramid levels to grasp as it is an innately human ability. Essentially, wisdom is knowledge in action. It’s using the knowledge gained in the previous level to answer questions such as ‘why does \_\_\_\_\_ happen?’ or ‘what is the best option between \_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_?” 

Wisdom develops over time as you continue to analyze and use your business data, information, and knowledge. Some people have a greater sense of wisdom and intuitiveness than others, but as you detect patterns and gain more experience, your sense of confidence and creativity will grow so you’re able to use knowledge to make concrete decisions.

## Traffic Light Example

It’s difficult to put the DIKW Pyramid concept into practice, so here is a [common illustration](https://www.i-scoop.eu/big-data-action-value-context/dikw-model/):

- Data: Red
- Information: South facing light on the corner of Pitt and George Streets has turned red.
- Knowledge: The traffic light I am driving towards has turned red.
- Wisdom: I should stop the car.

## Using data to make decisions

Data shouldn’t overwhelm you or be the bane of your existence, although it can feel like that sometimes. [Data-driven decision-making](https://www.datapine.com/blog/data-driven-decision-making-in-businesses/) is the common practice of collecting data, analyzing patterns and facts, and using it to create strategies and make business decisions based on evidence.

With data as the backbone of your business, your sense of knowledge and wisdom will grow. You will be able to make more confident decisions because you have concrete evidence to support them, and you can fully understand the impact that one element has on another.

## Build a foundation

There are some [arguments against the DIKW Pyramid](https://hbr.org/2010/02/data-is-to-info-as-info-is-not), saying that it’s much more complicated than it appears and that countless societal, psychological, and cultural factors need to be accounted for in order to make it more useful. That may be the case, but the pyramid, as it stands, is an excellent foundation on which to build your understanding of data analytics for your small business.
