## Tell a data story with the right application design

Data analytics are only as useful as the story they tell. For years, analytics were only accessible to highly trained IT professionals who could interpret and manipulate the data for others. In order to be effective, though, these insights need to be accessible to everyone and presented in such a way that connects various aspects of a business.

Businesses as a whole are getting more savvy and more demanding, as they should be. They realize the depth of potential information available to them, and they want to be able to use it efficiently to make better and faster decisions. Hence why there has been a trend in recent years towards developing more user-focused data analytics solutions.

The DAR (Dashboard, Analysis, Reporting) Method is a cornerstone of design and implementation for data analytics platforms. Let’s explore how the method is used to design creative and adaptable solutions for clients on their journey to tell their data story.

## What is the DAR Method?

[DAR is a methodology for building data analytics applications](http://princetechsolutions.com/dar-methodology-of-qlik-sense/). The concept is to start with a Dashboard, followed by Analysis, and close with Reporting. This funnel of information is meant to guide a user through the logical understanding of their data, helping them visualize the information and tie it all together to create a story. DAR is designed with creativity and flexibility in mind to meet varying requirements of clients.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard page is a top level view of the most important information. It requires the least amount of interaction, and is meant to be a snapshot of your key analytics. For many users, especially [those with limited time or just looking for basic information](https://community.qlik.com/t5/QlikView-Documents/Dashboard-Analysis-Reporting-DAR/ta-p/1488561?attachment-id=49648), the Dashboard page is all they will ever need.

This page should include a few high-level KPIs, ranked in order of importance and size. This structure allows users to easily scan the page and identify needed information. The Dashboard should also have a few basic filtering options, but not too many that it becomes a complicated feature.

## Analysis

Next stop, the Analysis pages. These pages take the information presented on the Dashboard and go a level deeper. Here, users can find answers to their questions sparked on the Dashboard.

The Analysis pages are often divided by topic or theme to separate and organize information efficiently. They are more interactive and offer users more options for filtering and viewing data. Analysis pages can scroll vertically and will include many more charts and tables than the Dashboard.

## Reporting

The final piece of the puzzle is the Reporting pages. This the last level of the DAR methodology and it’s where users go to get the most granular information about their business. These pages are an analyst’s dream.

They are filled with tabular data and lots of filtering options so users can really dig for the data they need. The Reporting pages are ultimately designed to facilitate action, which means they should be presented in a way that allows users to make better and faster decisions.

## Using data to tell a story

The DAR method organizes information into a funnel so users start with the most general data and work their way down in detail. It’s important to note, however, that applications using the DAR method are not linear. Users can hop around to various pages as they need.

This methodology is designed to help people make decisions by guiding them through the process from big to small, helping them visualize key data analytics, and how they relate to one another. It’s meant to manage the delivery and flow of information to tell a story.
