## Get the right information to make better and faster decisions.

Reporting is a vital part of any business operation, no matter the size. Without it, you’re like a ship lost at sea, forced to go whichever direction the wind blows. Diving into performance analytics across all departments is the only way to understand where you stand. It’s also the only way to create a strategy that propels you forward.

However, just because you pull reports on a regular basis doesn’t mean you’re doing so in the most effective way possible. For many small businesses, reporting may not even be a main priority as it takes a back seat to other seemingly more critical tasks like sales and order fulfillment.

It’s time to change that mentality. Reporting isn’t just about pulling the same set of numbers once a month and watching them go up or down. It shouldn’t be a dreaded task that you hate doing. The focus should be on pulling the right reports to measure whether or not the business is achieving predetermined benchmarks for success. Reporting should be viewed as a tool to help you achieve your overall strategy.

The problem is that there are so many possible reports to run and so many analytics to analyze that a lot of small businesses become overwhelmed and start pulling reports without any idea on whether or not it’s effective. Let’s explore some of the key factors to consider when creating reports so you can make sure you are getting the right information to make better and faster decisions.

## What reports are you running?

When you started reporting on business operations, did you really think through the data that would be most valuable or did you just start pulling reports because it seemed like a good thing to do? If you’re in the second camp, now is a good time to hit pause and consider whether you’re looking at the reports you need to inform your strategy.

There is a lot of information out there about the best reports for small businesses to run. While a lot of that data is very helpful, you might not need all of it. Or maybe there is a specific set of data you should be monitoring that is unique to your operation. Before you dedicate the time to creating and running a report, really think through its purpose and whether it will help your team in the future.

## How clean is your data?

A report is only as good as the data its using. It’s very common for small businesses to have messy or incorrect information about anything from customers to product configuration. Often, there is no systems administrator in charge of verifying and updating data. Multiple employees put information in with different formats and levels of dedication to maintaining it.

Without clean and uniform data, it’s likely that resulting reports will always be inaccurate to some degree. This can affect any aspect of your business. You can imagine the time and money wasted by basing department activities on the wrong information.

If you know that your systems need cleaning, prioritize this before you go any farther with reporting. You will drastically increase your effectiveness by starting with a clean set of data.

## How are reports created?

There is a reason why reporting on analytics is such a painful process for some. Many small businesses don’t have the software or knowledge to automate reporting, so it becomes a manual and time intensive activity. This can lead to an irregular reporting cycle as employees may not have time on a consistent basis to dedicate to the task.

Measure the cost in labor hours that you use to generate essential reports. You may be surprised by how high the number is. For your reports to be as effective as possible, the way they’re created has to be efficient. If not, you cancel out the positive impact of having reports by spending so much time gathering the data.

## How are reports shared?

Reports benefit not just the department they pertain to, but the company in general. When you create reports, how are they shared? Do they exist in a silo or are they used to craft an overall company strategy?

It’s important to recognize how intertwined departments are. Product sales data not only impacts the sales department but the marketing, operations, and administrative departments as well. Likewise, financial data should be accessible to everyone as it has effects for every employee.

## How will you use the data?

For reporting to be most effective, it needs to be a vital part of your business operations. If leadership and department heads don’t plan on integrating report data into future decisions, then the time spent gathering and organizing that information is wasted.

Before you invest the effort, make sure you have a place for analytics in your business strategy. Are you flexible and open-minded enough to accommodate changes based on what the data tells you? Reporting is only worth the time if you can ensure that it's incorporated into present and future business decisions.
