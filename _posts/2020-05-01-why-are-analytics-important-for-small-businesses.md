## How data analytics help reduce wasteful spending, measure success, and optimize business operations

Many businesses big and small dread the word ‘analytics’. They get a bad rap because gathering and analyzing data can be a messy and grueling process without the right tools. For most organizations, this data is siloed in various applications, filled with inconsistencies and errors. Cleaning and standardizing data means hours of manual labor, and a lot of small businesses simply don’t have the bandwidth or the manpower to do so.

But not including analytics in your business strategy isn’t an option either. How can you set goals, make decisions, and measure success without them? It’s time to stop thinking of analytics as a necessary evil and start thinking about them as tools for growth.

To do so, it’s important to understand how analytics can be a game changer for small businesses and provide companies with a standardized and automated data experience.

## Standardized data = less manual work and fewer errors

Your analytics will only be as good as the data provided, which is why clean and standardized data is so important. Small businesses spend hours gathering data from multiple sources, cleaning up errors, and standardizing metrics. This amount of manual labor is what tends to discourage businesses from keeping up with their analytics regularly.

However, standardization is critical because even the [best analytics software can’t correct inaccurate data](https://winpure.com/blog/business-benefits-data-standardization/). This approach gives you reliable analytics you can use to make better decisions. Plus, the time previously spent on cleaning and correcting data can now be directed to other projects.

## Putting data into context

Many small businesses rely on the built-in reporting features within each application for analytics. This method is certainly better than nothing, but it also forces the data from each application to live on its own. To truly analyze business performance, data has to be put into context with data from other sources.

For example, you can see through your website platform that traffic to your online store has increased. But without data from somewhere like Google Analytics, you won’t be able to see where that traffic is coming from, which pages people are visiting, how long they’re staying, and what’s incentivizing customers to buy.

Analytics allow you to maximize your investments in the tools you use to run your business. Combining data from various platforms helps you identify patterns and areas for improvement as you grow.

## Make better, faster decisions

Whether in marketing, sales, accounting, or operations, the best decisions are backed up with data. Having reliable information that’s accessible to employees empowers everyone to work smarter and faster.

[Setting meaningful goals](https://www.grow.com/blog/data-important-business) is a series of decisions that every business has to make regularly. Without historical data and projections, goals are just well-intentioned shots in the dark. Consider some of the following goals and how they compare with and without analytics.

### Increasing the number of new customers

- Before you set out to achieve any goal, you have to determine a benchmark of your current situation. Data analytics can tell you what your current rate of new customers is over the last designated time period. They can also tell you where new customers are coming from.
- With this basic information, you can set a goal to increase your new customer rate by 50% from 10 per week to 15 per week. You can also see that a lot of your new customers are coming from social media, so you invest more heavily in advertising there as well as optimizing your social media strategy.

### Improve advertising ROI

- For small businesses with limited budgets, investing in advertising is a big deal. Unfortunately, many businesses don’t have the knowledge or structure in place to calculate ROI accurately, let alone know whether it’s improved. Without this data, though, advertising can be an enormous waste of time and money.
- A data analytics solution can help you track advertising campaigns and determine which efforts are returning the most revenue. Marketing efforts require constant adjustment and testing, so with accessible data, your marketing team can see what’s working and not working to make more informed decisions and optimize campaigns as you go. 

### Increase revenue by 20%

- Increasing revenue is a pretty standard goal for any business. But to do so requires a solid understanding of the market, customer behaviors, and trends. Data analytics can help small businesses analyze their current customer base to attract a similar audience, enhance the experience, and increase customer retention.
- Analytics can also identify opportunities for new customers by predicting sales trends and giving businesses ideas for previously untapped markets.

There is an endless list of decisions small businesses make everyday that could be improved with data analytics. Having access to accurate data has unlimited potential and can help reduce wasteful spending, measure success, and optimize business operations.

## Accessible analytics for small businesses

It’s not hard to understand how fundamentally important analytics are for any small business operation. The trouble for most companies comes at the execution stage. You have data through the various platforms and applications you use, but only certain people have access to it, it’s in different formats, and it’s difficult to visualize how data from one program interacts with data from another. Put simply, you need to automate your reporting and bring it all into a user-friendly dashboard so you have real-time access to the information you need to run your business.
