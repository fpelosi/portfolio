excerpt: "Segmenting your customer base is crucial for business success, emphasizing the importance of the top 20% contributing significantly to revenue. Factors like actual revenue, referrals, feedback, and consistency help identify this group. Conversely, addressing the bottom 20%, including hand-holders, flakes, swindlers, and penny-pinchers, prevents resource drain. Regularly monitoring and segmenting customer data empowers informed decision-making, ensuring efficient allocation of resources."

Any small business owner knows that not all customers are created equal. Some yield much higher returns than others with less effort, some are high maintenance, and some are simply nicer and more appreciative of your services than others.

It’s critical to the success of your company that you segment your customer base so you can identify those who are helping you grow and those who are holding you back. Just like any other relationship, you may need to make adjustments or cut ties with these customers completely for your overall health.

Let’s explore how you can begin segmenting your customers so you can focus more time and effort into the people propelling you forward.

## The 80/20 rule

As it relates to customers, the [Pareto Principle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/03/07/80-20-rule/#25d0b1043814) indicates that 20% of your customers make up 80% of your revenue. Likewise, 20% of your customers cause 80% of your stress. 

It’s very common for small businesses to want to do everything under the sun for every customer. But the reality of the situation is that some customers are more valuable than others, and most of the work should be invested in the top 20% of your base in order to yield the greatest return. This is not to say that the other 80% should be ignored, but as a small business, you have to use your time and resources as efficiently as possible.

The only way you can cater to your customer base effectively is to segment them properly and identify those that are assets vs. those that are liabilities. This will help you formulate a plan for where you invest your business’ time and resources.

## How to identify your top 20%

While overall revenue is often the go-to qualifier, there are many factors to consider when identifying your best customers.

- **Actual revenue** - Some of your highest paying customers may also require extensive time and effort. These items need to be [quantified and subtracted from the sale](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/how-to-identify-your-most-valuable-customers/) to determine the actual revenue. You may find that your most valuable customers in this sense are those with lower sales figures.

- **Referrals** \- Evangelists and ambassadors are customers who are so thrilled with your product or service that they spread the word and refer others to you. These customers significantly increase in value the more business they bring your way.

- **Feedback** \- You will hear feedback from either your most satisfied or your most dissatisfied customers. Those who are willing to share their positive experience with you means that they were happy enough with your business to go out of their way to let you know. These customers are worth taking care of whether they are an evangelist that constantly sings your praises or someone who leaves a one-time five star review on your website.

- **Consistency and longevity** - Common business knowledge tells us that acquiring a new customer is ten times more expensive than retaining an existing one. Loyal customers that make consistent purchases over an extended period of time save you the acquisition costs, which results in more revenue. 

## How to identify your bottom 20%

There are probably a few ‘bad’ customers coming to mind for you right now. This group is usually easy to identify as they cause the most stress and frustration among your employees. As a small business, you simply can’t afford to engage with these customers the same way you do with your top 20%. Here are some [key behaviors to help you identify](https://www.nextiva.com/blog/bad-customers.html) who they are.

- **Hand holders** - Of course, customers should expect a certain level of customer service from their business of choice, but there does come a point where it crosses a line. This includes customers who constantly submit support tickets, refuse to use resources provided, and demand hand holding through every detail. This uses up valuable time for customer support that could be used helping others. If you have a support ticket system, you can pull reports to identify the most frequent and involved submissions.

- **Flakes** \- Flaky customers include those who are constantly changing expectations, are difficult to get a hold of, and even blow off important meetings. These are perhaps the most frustrating customers to deal with because it’s like trying to catch smoke. The time you spend on developing plans and preparing notes for your customers is valuable, and those that take advantage of it are a drain on your resources.

- **Swindlers** \- Some customers will do anything to save a penny or get something for free, which pushes them to lie and cheat their way into doing so. This can include lying about another employee’s actions, claiming they never received an item, submitting a false negative review, and even lying about their ability to pay. Keeping notes on customers is critical so you can track these types of communications and get to the bottom of it without wasting any more of your company’s time.

- **Penny pinchers** - Customers who constantly pay late or try to shave off every possible penny from their invoice obviously affect your bottom line as they aren’t contributing to your cash flow the way they should. The time spent tracking down payment or ‘negotiating’ with these customers is also very costly as you could be spending this time making sales and acquiring new leads.

As you identify the customers weighing you down, you’ll have to make decisions about either modifying your interactions with them or firing them (yes, you can fire a customer). Ask yourself what the value is of keeping this customer vs. the cost of letting them go.  

## Dig into the customer data

Developing a system to continuously monitor your critical business activity, including customer data, allows you to make better and faster decisions. Identifying and segmenting customers needs to be done regularly, but it can be a very involved process if your information is stored in separate places with various formats. Review your data sources, build systems to capture and clean that data, and deliver them to you in an ecosystem of interactive dashboards that bring the data right to your fingertips.
