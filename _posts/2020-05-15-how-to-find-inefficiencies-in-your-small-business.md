excerpt: "Efficiency is crucial for small businesses, and the Pareto Principle suggests focusing on the vital 20% driving 80% of results. Regular team discussions, customer feedback, and insights from vendors help identify inefficiencies. Metrics like task completion rates, labor-to-output ratios, and sales outreach effectiveness provide measurable indicators. Establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) ensures ongoing efficiency monitoring, promoting continuous improvement for small businesses seeking optimal productivity."

## Identifying opportunities to optimize your business processes

Inefficiency can kill a small business. There simply isn’t the bandwidth for it the same way there is in larger businesses and corporations. Every dollar and hour spent needs to be maximized and used completely.

Owning a small business, though, can feel like complete chaos. There is a rush to get things set up and make big decisions. Band aids are used instead of more permanent solutions to save valuable time and money. All of these lead to inefficiencies that only grow with time.

Identifying and resolving these inefficiencies allows you to get out of your own way and truly optimize your business. Let’s take a look at how to do that and how to establish KPIs to track certain aspects of your productivity.

## Pareto Principle on efficiency

Everyone is familiar with some version of the [Pareto Principle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/03/07/80-20-rule/#3a9a93b83814), also known as the 80/20 rule. You can use it to identify inefficiency in your business by thinking about the fact that 20% of your efforts are producing 80% of your results. That’s not to say you should completely write off the other 80% of your efforts, but you can start there to find opportunities for optimization.

Apply the Pareto Principle to every area of your business to really put things in perspective:

- 20% of your sales staff produces 80% of your sales
- 20% of your customers equate to 80% of your revenue
- 20% of your marketing efforts account for 80% of your results

If you can [identify what that 20% is](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davelavinsky/2014/01/20/pareto-principle-how-to-use-it-to-dramatically-grow-your-business/#6acf70a13901), you can shift your energy away from some of the things that may be sucking up valuable time and resources to focus on what’s really driving results.

## How to identify and eliminate inefficiencies

The only way to find weaknesses in your processes is to get your hands dirty and start stirring the pot. Your team is going to be the most useful tool you have in uncovering room for improvement.

Your employees will have no problem giving you feedback on processes and tasks they find unnecessary or time consuming. So, it’s important you give them the opportunity to voice their opinions. [Set up regular brainstorming sessions](https://smallbizclub.com/run-and-grow/operations/4-tips-identify-fix-basic-business-inefficiencies/) or just establish an open communication policy so they know they can bring issues to the table whenever they arise.

Your team is also the greatest resource for solutions. Since they are closest to the problem, they have probably thought through ways to make it better. Ask for their input on common areas of inefficiency like:

- Manual work that can be automated
- Administrative tasks that can be delegated to someone else
- Spending time searching for information and documents that can be properly organized with the right software
- Unnecessary meetings or activities that can be conveyed via email or a collaboration tool

Another place you can turn to for ideas is your customer reviews and complaints. These will give you great insight into what’s working about your business and what isn’t. Are there a lot of complaints about late shipments? Maybe some comments about how hard it was to get a hold of someone? Although they may be hard to hear at times, these all provide opportunities for you to improve your processes and reduce chances of similar complaints in the future.

You should also consider talking to your vendors for insight. They work with a lot of businesses and see a variety of operation styles. They can give you suggestions based on best practices they encounter every day.

## How to measure efficiency

Staying on top of inefficiencies is a lifelong battle for your business. There will always be chances to cut corners that can create new problems all over again. Establishing metrics and KPIs to track efficiencies is an absolutely necessity. What those metrics are, depend completely on your business and what you consider important.

The most obvious metric is [how much work your staff is producing](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-measure-productivity). You can break projects down into tasks and track the amount of tasks completed over a certain time period. [Project management software](https://www.breathehr.com/blog/how-to-measure-employee-productivity) is very helpful to track the amount of open tasks remaining, completed projects, and time invested per task.

Manufacturing businesses often use a cost-benefit or input-output ratio to evaluate how efficiently people are working. Compare the total amount of time in labor hours to the amount of goods produced. You can do this on an individual or group basis depending on your size. 

To establish sales efficiency metrics, consider comparing the number of sales outreach efforts to the number of results (quotes created, invoices sent, orders confirmed). Customer service efficiency can be measured with surveys, average response time, and average resolution length.
