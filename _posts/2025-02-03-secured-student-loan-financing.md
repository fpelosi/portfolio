excerpt: With student debt reaching unsustainable levels, it's time to rethink how we finance higher education. This post explores a bold proposal — structuring student loans based on the economic value of degrees. By aligning borrowing with earning potential, we can reduce defaults, encourage informed decision-making, and hold institutions accountable.

The cost of higher education has skyrocketed, often leaving graduates burdened with debt that far exceeds the earning potential of their degrees. This disconnect raises an important question: Should student loans be structured based on the market value of degrees? This article explores the inefficiency of financing all degrees equally and proposes a solution—securing student loans based on the economic return of different fields of study.

The purpose of this proposal is not to dismiss the intrinsic value of education, such as personal growth, critical thinking, and artistic expression. However, given the substantial financial investment involved—often reaching tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars—it is reasonable to expect a financial return. By realigning loan structures with earning potential, we can create a more sustainable and fair system for both students and lenders.

## Secured vs. Unsecured Loans

To understand the proposed changes, it's important to first differentiate between secured and unsecured loans:

- **Secured Loans**: Backed by collateral (e.g., mortgages, auto loans), reducing risk for lenders.
- **Unsecured Loans**: Not tied to any asset (e.g., credit cards, student loans currently), leading to higher interest rates and default risks.

Currently, student loans are unsecured, meaning they are granted without assessing the earning potential of the degree being financed. Applying the logic of secured loans could lead to more responsible lending and borrowing practices.

## The Economic Value of a Degree

The U.S. Department of Education's [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) provides data on various degrees, including costs and salary outcomes. Consider the following comparison of two degrees from the University at Buffalo:

- [**History Degree**](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school?196088-University-at-Buffalo&fos_code=5401&fos_credential=3): Median earnings after graduation of $50,679 with a median debt after graduation of $21,248.
- [**Computer Science Degree**](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school?196088-University-at-Buffalo&fos_code=1107&fos_credential=3): Higher median earnings of $110,541 with a median debt after graduation of $19,000.

*The debt figures provided only include federal loans originated at the school awarding the credential; it excludes private student loans, Parent PLUS loans, and federal loans originated at previously attended schools.*

Comparatively, the Computer Science degree provides a clearer path to loan repayment. STEM and professional degrees often yield higher salaries than humanities and arts degrees. Yet, all students currently face similar borrowing terms, leading many to struggle with repayment. This system has contributed to the ongoing student debt crisis, where graduates with low-earning degrees carry debt for decades, limiting their financial freedom.

## Proposal: Secured Student Loan Financing

To address this issue, student loans should be structured similarly to secured loans:

- **Degree as Collateral**: Loan eligibility and amounts should be tied to projected earnings.
- **Loan Caps Based on Degree**: Higher loan amounts for high-return degrees, lower caps for fields with lower market demand.
- **Risk-Based Interest Rates**: Lower interest rates for degrees with high employment rates and salaries, reflecting their lower default risk.

### Scenarios of Secured Loan Financing

1. **Full Financing**: Students pursuing high-return degrees may receive full loan coverage.
2. **Partial Financing**: For lower-earning degrees, loans supplement scholarships, part-time work, or grants.
3. **No Financing (Cash, Grants, Scholarships)**: Students paying outright or through scholarships avoid loans entirely.

## Addressing Socioeconomic Disparities

A concern with this model is that students from wealthy backgrounds can afford any degree, while lower-income students may be restricted based on loan availability. However, this issue already exists—students currently take on massive debt without clear repayment prospects. A secured loan system would encourage alternative education paths, such as:

- **Trade schools, apprenticeships, and bootcamps** that offer strong job placement and lower costs.
- **Stronger scholarship programs** for students pursuing lower-earning but socially valuable degrees (e.g., arts, humanities, social work).

## The Role of Universities and Accountability

Colleges must also be held accountable for student outcomes. Institutions should:

- Provide transparent data on job placement and salaries for each major.
- Limit tuition hikes that are not justified by post-graduation earnings.
- Focus on career-readiness rather than nonessential campus expenditures (e.g., luxury dorms, climbing walls).

By aligning financing with expected earnings, universities will be incentivized to offer degrees that provide real economic value.

## The Role of Education in Society

While education fosters personal growth, it must also prepare students for economic stability. The principle of "borrow responsibly, repay sustainably" should guide student financing. Balancing intellectual exploration with financial practicality is essential in ensuring higher education remains a pathway to success, not lifelong debt.

## Path Forward

To address the inefficiency of the current student loan system, we must align borrowing with economic outcomes. A secured loan model would:

- Reduce student debt defaults by matching financing to earning potential.
- Encourage informed decision-making among prospective students.
- Hold institutions accountable for graduate success.

While challenges exist, including potential equity concerns, policy adjustments—such as targeted scholarships—can mitigate these effects. Ultimately, education financing must evolve to reflect economic realities, ensuring students are set up for financial stability, not financial hardship.
