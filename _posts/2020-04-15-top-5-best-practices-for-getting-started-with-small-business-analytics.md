## Consider these factors to get the most out of your data

Regardless of size, analytics are a gateway to smarter and more efficient business operations. Small businesses, in particular, can use analytics to make up for what they lack in budget, personnel, and reach. Understanding and embracing analytics is one thing, however. Implementing them correctly and using them to their full potential is another. 

Defining a strategy for your data and using it to further your business goals is an overwhelming task, especially for a small business just starting its analytics venture. Which of the millions of data points do you focus on? How do you make the data usable and accessible? And how will the data contribute to your business decisions?

These are all questions that need to be answered as you get started implementing analytics into your overall strategy. There are many other factors to consider to ensure that you are getting the most out of your data and that it becomes a supplemental tool rather than a time wasting task.

Here are some best practices for getting started on your small business analytics journey. These tips are meant to help you build a strong foundation for an efficient and effective data workflow.

## Choose an internal sponsor

An [internal sponsor](https://help.tableau.com/current/blueprint/en-us/bp_executive_sponsor_roles_responsibilities.htm) is someone in your organization who is going to own, create, and implement your data strategy. At a larger organization, there will likely be multiple sponsors for different departments, but for small businesses, usually one or two sponsors will suffice.

> **A lack of ownership over the analytics process inevitably leads to multiple systems doing redundant work with little integration, and an overload of manual data gathering.**

A sponsor helps create and communicate the overall vision for how your business is going to use and implement analytics. They communicate with various departments to ensure that the analytics strategy represents all facets of the business and contributes to better overall collaboration. Ultimately, they decide on the data tools, processes, and guidelines placed into effect to achieve certain goals.

Sponsors are also in charge of monitoring data integrity and final reporting results. They are the analytics liaison that ensures data is at the center of every business decision and that it’s being used properly.

## Assess your current data situation

In order for your sponsor and your organization to have any chance of success, you have to take an honest look at your data situation. Do an audit of the current software, applications, and programs you’re using. Assess the purpose of each one and whether they are fulfilling it the way you intended. This is a chance to streamline, reduce, and update your tools where possible.

> **The analytics tool you choose is only as good as the information it’s given. If you expect your tool to report on certain aspects of your business, make sure it integrates with your applications and that your data is clean and prepared to be reported on.**

Data platforms have different permissions and partners, so do your due diligence to find a tool that can work with your sources.

## Use data to tell a story

Data reaches its peak effectiveness when it’s used in conjunction with other data to tell a story. Individual metrics are useful, but they only show you a small piece of the overall picture. A great analytics tool will automate the process into a visually appealing dashboard, so users can easily spot trends and combine their sources to improve the customer experience.

For example, many marketing departments often have a difficult time tracking ROI. Customer source data may not be accurate, and if the department is running multiple campaigns at once, it’s not easy identifying where customers are coming from. However, an analytics tool that integrates data can make all the difference.

Trying to track the impact of ad spend is enough to give any marketer a headache. How does an increase or decrease in budget on a social media ad impact website traffic? A data platform gathering analytics from both sources can tell you just that. When you have automated real-time information presented in an easy-to-understand way, you can see how your ad spends are impacting your web traffic along with thousands of other business decisions you’re making. 

A great dashboard empowers you to take your data, create a story, and run with it. You can see where customers are coming from, what efforts of yours are working and not working, and even start to intuit buying behaviors.

## Use data to improve internal communication and collaboration

Without a centralized analytics tool, departments often operate in silos. They have their own applications and gather data in their own way. There is very little sharing, and thus, little knowledge of what other aspects of your business are doing.

> **A quality data tool brings everyone together on the same page. Every employee is accessing the same data source and is able to consult information from other departments that they previously could not.**

This common pool of data enables everyone to [make better decisions](https://www.datapine.com/blog/business-intelligence-for-small-business/) because they can see how those decisions will impact the company as a whole rather than their individual team.

Departments are not meant to operate individually. Analytics software can help employees learn about what’s going on in other parts of the business, which enables better communication and innovation internally. Take the ad spend example above. Now that the marketing, digital, and sales teams can see how marketing’s efforts are impacting website traffic and revenue, those departments can more effectively collaborate on future campaigns.

## Make better decisions faster

Before you can correctly implement an analytics solution, you have to decide which data is most important to your business. Consider your business goals and how you want to use data to achieve them. The bottom line is, there is simply too much information out there for anyone to absorb. If you don’t establish an analytics plan in the beginning to gather the data you truly need, you’ll be too overwhelmed to effectively do anything with it.

> **Your analytics tool should be designed to help you make better business decisions at a faster pace. Identify a few key questions that you need answered to get started.**

- Are there holes in your processes that could be answered with better data?
- Is there recurring information you’ll need to access on a regular basis?

Design your tool and your dashboard around these. You can always tweak and modify as you go. Remember, visuals and presentation are arguably just as important as the data itself. This tool should empower your employees to make better decisions on an individual level as well, which means it needs to be accessible and easily understood. It shouldn’t take a translator to decode your business analytics.

## Choose the right analytics tool

Choosing the right tool gets you one step closer to achieving your data goals. The right tool automates your reporting so you and your team can get back to growing your business instead of gathering and interpreting data.
