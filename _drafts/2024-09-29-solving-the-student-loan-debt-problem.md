excerpt: In the context of trading, "Maker" and "Taker" refer to two different types of market participants based on the role they play in executing trades on a cryptocurrency exchange or any financial market.

- assumption: the primary role of education is to prepare citizens to be successful in the economy they live in. If we’re investing 10s or 100s of thousands on education it’s safe to say we should expect some financial ROI
- there are cultural, literary, and artistic benefits to some degree programs that will only be discussed briefly
- Explain how are other loan products are secured
- Explain the difference between secured and unsecured loans
- Explain the value of a degree in the marketplace. Studies showing that someone with X degree will graduate and make $Y
- Explain why people graduate with debt that they can’t afford to pay off.
- hypothesis: people studied in programs that cost more than their degree is worth in the market place.
- Proposal: secured student loan financing. grant loans that are secured by a degree that is worth a salary that can afford to pay of the loan amount
- Scenarios include no financing where through cash or grant/scholarship, partial, or full financing
- Requirements: maintain grades good enough to graduate with that degree. Colleges and universities responsible for reporting criteria to Fed
- these requirements are similar to maintain scholarships
- This program also reinforces that while college is a time to explore who you are and your identity it’s also about exploring what contribution you will make to society, economy, and country
- Rooted in principles: repay what you borrow
- These opportunities are and should be treated as such
- While principles of individuality are important, self awareness, self esteem, critical and creative thinking, personal finance, we cannot neglect our responsibilities to our neighbors and communities.
- Need to speak on supply and demand and as less financing is available for degrees then the demand for people in that role will go up and therefore the salaries
- Medical student analogy
- reshape the way we learn: Talk about alternatives to learning arts: Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and Roycroft
- Personal growth can be found in many ways: gap years, military service, volunteer and service programs

You've got a fascinating idea for a paper that integrates the economics of education with student loan policy reform. To help you flesh this out further, here’s a possible outline along with expanded thoughts on key points in your framework:

  

### **Working Title: "A Secured Approach to Student Loan Financing: Aligning Education with Economic Reality"**

  

---

  

### **1. Introduction**

   - **Assumption**: The primary role of education is to prepare citizens to succeed in the economy.

      - Introduce the broader debate about the purpose of education (e.g., personal growth vs. economic success).

      - Acknowledge cultural, literary, and artistic benefits of education, while emphasizing your primary focus on economic preparation.

   - **Thesis**: This paper explores the mismatch between the cost of education and the market value of certain degrees, proposing a solution where student loans are secured based on the economic value of degrees.

  

---

  

### **2. Secured vs. Unsecured Loans: A Financial Framework**

   - **Definition of Secured Loans**: Loans backed by collateral, reducing risk for the lender (e.g., mortgages, auto loans).

   - **Definition of Unsecured Loans**: Loans not tied to any asset (e.g., credit cards, student loans currently), which tend to have higher interest rates and higher default risks.

   - **Why Unsecured Student Loans Are Risky**: Student loans are a significant financial product but remain unsecured, often without direct evaluation of the earning potential of the degree being financed.

      - Contrast with secured loans, which are approved based on the value of the collateral (house, car). Why not apply this logic to student loans?

  

---

  

### **3. The Economic Value of a Degree**

   - **Studies on Degree Earnings**: Cite statistics and studies showing the salary differentials based on degree type.

      - For example, someone with a degree in engineering might make significantly more than someone with a degree in arts, yet the cost of education might not reflect this disparity.

   - **Mismatch Between Degree Cost and Market Value**: Degrees that cost more than the graduate can afford to repay (due to low starting salaries).

      - Example: A humanities major may incur the same debt as a STEM major but earn a much lower salary upon graduation.

   - **Current Student Debt Crisis**: Explore why so many graduates are burdened with loans they cannot afford to pay off. Mention default rates and the psychological/social burden of debt.

  

---

  

### **4. Hypothesis: The Real Problem**

   - **Key Argument**: People are studying in programs that cost more than their degrees are worth in the marketplace.

      - Cite case studies or anecdotes to support this hypothesis (e.g., specific majors with high debt burdens but low earning potential).

      - Discuss the societal pressures to pursue higher education regardless of its financial viability.

  

---

  

### **5. Proposal: Secured Student Loan Financing**

   - **Basic Concept**: Only grant loans secured by degrees that have a demonstrated value in the marketplace, ensuring that graduates can afford to pay back their loans.

      - **Degree as Collateral**: The degree itself acts as a "secured asset" of sorts, guaranteeing repayment based on expected salary projections.

      - **Loan Caps Based on Degree**: For instance, a student pursuing a degree in computer science may be eligible for a higher loan limit than one pursuing fine arts, based on projected salaries.

      - This approach balances economic reality with the need to finance education, ensuring students aren’t overburdened with debt they cannot repay.

  

---

  

### **6. Scenarios of Secured Loan Financing**

   - **No Financing (cash, grants, scholarships)**: Those who can afford to pay outright (or who earn scholarships) don't rely on loans.

   - **Partial Financing**: Students may take out smaller loans to supplement scholarships, personal contributions, or part-time work, with the loan amount based on projected salary.

   - **Full Financing**: In some cases, students may need full loan coverage, but loan amounts should still be aligned with earning potential. 

  

---

  

### **7. Requirements and Accountability**

   - **Academic Performance**: Students must maintain a certain GPA or meet other performance metrics to retain loan eligibility, similar to maintaining scholarships.

      - Colleges and universities would be responsible for reporting students' academic standing to ensure loan eligibility.

   - **School Accountability**: Encourage institutions to offer more transparency around the value of their programs in the job market, helping students make informed decisions about their education.

      - Institutions that offer degrees with poor job prospects should be held accountable in some way (e.g., by limiting how much students can borrow for those programs).

  

---

  

### **8. The Role of Education in Society**

   - **Balancing Individual Growth with Economic Responsibility**: While college is a time for personal exploration, it must also prepare students for their roles in society, the economy, and their communities.

      - **Core Principle**: "Repay what you borrow" reflects a broader responsibility to society. These are opportunities, not entitlements, and they should be treated as such.

      - Acknowledge that self-awareness, creativity, and individuality are critical but should be balanced with economic self-sufficiency.

  

---

  

### **9. Benefits and Challenges of the Proposal**

   - **Benefits**:

      - Aligns student debt with earning potential, reducing defaults.

      - Encourages students to choose degrees with higher job market value or more affordable alternatives.

      - Reduces burden on taxpayers, who often bear the cost of student loan forgiveness programs.

   - **Challenges**:

      - Possible pushback from institutions offering low-paying degree programs.

      - Potential ethical concerns over limiting educational opportunities based on market demand.

      - Risks of exacerbating income inequality, as higher-paying fields (e.g., STEM) get more accessible financing than others (e.g., the arts).

  

---

  

### **10. Conclusion**

   - Restate the thesis and summarize key points.

   - Conclude by arguing that education policy must evolve to reflect the financial realities of the marketplace while still supporting intellectual exploration.

   - Emphasize the need for responsible borrowing and repayment, as well as the broader social responsibility of both students and institutions.
