- Proposal: secured student loan financing. grant loans that are secured by a degree that is worth a salary that can afford to pay of the loan amount

- These opportunities are and should be treated as such
- While principles of individuality are important, self awareness, self esteem, critical and creative thinking, personal finance, we cannot neglect our responsibilities to our neighbors and communities.
- Need to speak on supply and demand and as less financing is available for degrees then the demand for people in that role will go up and therefore the salaries
