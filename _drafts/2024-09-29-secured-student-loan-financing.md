- assumption: the primary role of education is to prepare citizens to be successful in the economy they live in. If we’re investing 10s or 100s of thousands on education it’s safe to say we should expect some financial ROI
- there are cultural, literary, and artistic benefits to some degree programs that will only be discussed briefly
- Explain how are other loan products are secured
- Explain the difference between secured and unsecured loans
- Explain the value of a degree in the marketplace. Studies showing that someone with X degree will graduate and make $Y
- Explain why people graduate with debt that they can’t afford to pay off.
- hypothesis: people studied in programs that cost more than their degree is worth in the market place.
- Proposal: secured student loan financing. grant loans that are secured by a degree that is worth a salary that can afford to pay of the loan amount
- Scenarios include no financing where through cash or grant/scholarship, partial, or full financing
- Requirements: maintain grades good enough to graduate with that degree. Colleges and universities responsible for reporting criteria to Fed
- these requirements are similar to maintain scholarships
- This program also reinforces that while college is a time to explore who you are and your identity it’s also about exploring what contribution you will make to society, economy, and country
- Rooted in principles: repay what you borrow
- These opportunities are and should be treated as such
- While principles of individuality are important, self awareness, self esteem, critical and creative thinking, personal finance, we cannot neglect our responsibilities to our neighbors and communities.
- Need to speak on supply and demand and as less financing is available for degrees then the demand for people in that role will go up and therefore the salaries
- Medical student analogy
- reshape the way we learn: Talk about alternatives to learning arts: Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and Roycroft
- Personal growth can be found in many ways: gap years, military service, volunteer and service programs

# Introduction
This post explores the mismatch between the cost of education and the market value of certain degrees, proposing a solution where student loans are secured based on the economic value of degrees. This post is written from the perspective that the primary role of education is to prepare individuals to succeed in the economy. I am comfortable making this assumption because if individuals are investing 10s or 100s of thousands on education it’s safe to say we should expect some financial return on that investment.

The purpose of this post is not to say there aren't enormous personal growth and development opportunities such as self awareness, self esteem, critical and creative thinking, and personal finance. However the purpose is to draw attention to the inefficiency of the relationship between undergraduate degree costs and salary expectations.

I acknowledge there are cultural, literary, and artistic benefits of education, but in this post I will  primarily focus on economic preparation.

# Secured vs. Unsecured Loans
Before continuing with this post, I'd like to explain an existing financial framework. Throughout our day-to-day we may use both secured and unsecured loans without even knowing.

   - Definition of Secured Loans: Loans backed by collateral, reducing risk for the lender (e.g., mortgages, auto loans).
   - Definition of Unsecured Loans: Loans not tied to any asset (e.g., credit cards, student loans currently), which tend to have higher interest rates and higher default risks.
   - Why Unsecured Student Loans Are Risky: Student loans are a significant financial product but remain unsecured, often without direct evaluation of the earning potential of the degree being financed.
  
  In contrast with secured loans, which are approved based on the value of the collateral (house, car), student loans are unsecured. Why not apply the logic of secured loans to student loans?

# The Economic Value of a Degree
The [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) is a great resource published by the U.S. Department of Education. The scorecard helps prospective students find the right fit by providing data to compare colleges: their fields of study, costs, admissions, results, and more.

Seeing as I live in New York, let's use the University at Buffalo, the largest State University of New York, as an example. 


Studies on Degree Earnings**: Cite statistics and studies showing the salary differentials based on degree type.

      - For example, someone with a degree in engineering might make significantly more than someone with a degree in arts, yet the cost of education might not reflect this disparity.

   - **Mismatch Between Degree Cost and Market Value**: Degrees that cost more than the graduate can afford to repay (due to low starting salaries).

      - Example: A humanities major may incur the same debt as a STEM major but earn a much lower salary upon graduation.

   - **Current Student Debt Crisis**: Explore why so many graduates are burdened with loans they cannot afford to pay off. Mention default rates and the psychological/social burden of debt.

People are studying in programs that cost more than their degrees are worth in the marketplace.

# Proposal: Secured Student Loan Financing
- **Basic Concept**: Only grant loans secured by degrees that have a demonstrated value in the marketplace, ensuring that graduates can afford to pay back their loans.
- **Degree as Collateral**: The degree itself acts as a "secured asset" of sorts, guaranteeing repayment based on expected salary projections.
- **Loan Caps Based on Degree**: For instance, a student pursuing a degree in computer science may be eligible for a higher loan limit than one pursuing fine arts, based on projected salaries.
This approach balances economic reality with the need to finance education, ensuring students aren’t overburdened with debt they cannot repay.
## Scenarios of Secured Loan Financing
Some examples of what financing would look like below.
- **Full Financing**: In some cases, students may need full loan coverage, but loan amounts should still be aligned with earning potential.
- **Partial Financing**: Students may take out smaller loans to supplement scholarships, personal contributions, or part-time work, with the loan amount based on projected salary.
- **No Financing (cash, grants, scholarships)**: Those who can afford to pay outright (or who earn scholarships) don't rely on loans. 
# A Socio-Economic Disadvantage
There is a clear advantage to those who come from wealthy backgrounds being able to finance their own tuition. They have the luxury of choosing any degree and attending any institution regardless of it's worth in the marketplace. While an individual without the means to pay their own way, would be limited to what degree programs they can obtain financing. This may limit their ability to attend college if they do not have the grades to attend on scholarship.

## A Present Reality
I would argue that this challenge already exists. In the scenario described above a loans is issued, and if a degree with low earnings expectations is earned the individual is forced to carry this debt burden for decades to come. From personal experience, this limits one's opportunity later on in life such as pursuing a small business or owning a home. Both of theirs opportunities require financing which in turn requires a low debt-to-income ratio.

## Realignment
This would lower the demand for higher education as individuals seek out trades, vocational, and apprentice programs or alternative education like bootcamps. Universities would be encouraged to rebuild their degree programs with an emphasis on life beyond campus.

Discuss the societal pressures to pursue higher education regardless of its financial viability. cite the cristo rey network model. Shouldn't the true measure be financial / economic stability. re aligning this benchmark would focus on

# Requirements and Accountability

Academic Performance: Students must maintain passing GPA or meet other performance metrics to retain loan eligibility, similar to maintaining scholarships.
Colleges and universities would be responsible for reporting students' academic standing to ensure loan eligibility.

School Accountability Encourage institutions to offer more transparency around the value of their programs in the job market, helping students make informed decisions about their education. Force institution's to prioritize the reduction of tuition costs while maintaining a quality education.

Institutions that offer degrees with poor job prospects should be held accountable in some way (e.g., by limiting how much students can borrow for those programs).
      - By aligning the amount of financing to projected salaries, there will be indirect constraints on the institutions that offer the degrees. Giving students the ability to take out unsecured loans and give/transfer that money to private institutions does not incentive to reduce spending and decrease the tuition cost. This is why we see institutions spending on movie theatres and rock climbing walls.
      - Institutions would be indirectly held accountable for building degree programs that place students in good paying jobs after graduation 

# The Role of Education in Society**

   - **Balancing Individual Growth with Economic Responsibility**: While college is a time for personal exploration, it must also prepare students for their roles in society, the economy, and their communities.

      - **Core Principle**: "Repay what you borrow" reflects a broader responsibility to society. These are opportunities, not entitlements, and they should be treated as such.

      - Acknowledge that self-awareness, creativity, and individuality are critical but should be balanced with economic self-sufficiency.

# Benefits and Challenges of the Proposal**

   - **Benefits**:

      - Aligns student debt with earning potential, reducing defaults.

      - Encourages students to choose degrees with higher job market value or more affordable alternatives.

      - Reduces burden on taxpayers, who often bear the cost of student loan forgiveness programs.

   - **Challenges**:

      - Possible pushback from institutions offering low-paying degree programs.

      - Potential ethical concerns over limiting educational opportunities based on market demand.

      - Risks of exacerbating income inequality, as higher-paying fields (e.g., STEM) get more accessible financing than others (e.g., the arts).

### **10. Conclusion**

   - Restate the thesis and summarize key points.

   - Conclude by arguing that education policy must evolve to reflect the financial realities of the marketplace while still supporting intellectual exploration.

   - Emphasize the need for responsible borrowing and repayment, as well as the broader social responsibility of both students and institutions.
