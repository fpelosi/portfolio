excerpt: "Investing in cryptocurrencies can be both thrilling and perplexing for the average user. One strategy that offers a steady approach is dollar-cost averaging (DCA). If you're navigating this journey through platforms like Coinbase, understanding the fee structure is paramount, especially when employing the DCA strategy that involves frequent trades."

In the context of trading, "Maker" and "Taker" refer to two different types of market participants based on the role they play in executing trades on a cryptocurrency exchange or any financial market.

1. **Maker:**
   - A maker is a trader who provides liquidity to the market by placing a limit order that doesn't get immediately matched with an existing order.
   - The term "maker" comes from the fact that these traders make the market by adding liquidity.
   - Makers usually place limit orders above the current market price when buying or below the market price when selling.

2. **Taker:**
   - A taker is a trader who removes liquidity from the market by placing an order that matches an existing order on the order book.
   - The term "taker" signifies that these traders take liquidity from the market when they execute market orders.
   - Takers often place market orders or limit orders that match with existing orders on the order book.

**How Fees Apply:**
- On many cryptocurrency exchanges, there are different fee structures for makers and takers.
- Makers may receive a rebate or a lower fee because they contribute to the market's liquidity.
- Takers may incur higher fees because they are taking liquidity from the market.

These distinctions are designed to encourage traders to add liquidity to the market, contributing to its overall health and efficiency. The specific fee structure can vary between different exchanges.
