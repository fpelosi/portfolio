excerpt: I often find myself in a position where I feel the need for more information to solve a problem, and others have already moved on to finding solutions. I sense that people are quick to jump to solutions, but it could just be the analyst in me preferring to delve deeper into the problem. I frequently participate in discovery sessions intended to understand the problem, and I notice that conversations tend to gravitate towards technical solutions and how we can get things done quickly. On the drive home from work, I was trying to understand why people seem to value discussions around solutions more than a deep understanding of the problem.

test I often find myself in a position where I feel the need for more information to solve a problem, and others have already moved on to finding solutions. I sense that people are quick to jump to solutions, but it could just be the analyst in me preferring to delve deeper into the problem.

I frequently participate in discovery sessions intended to understand the problem, and I notice that conversations tend to gravitate towards technical solutions and how we can get things done quickly. On the drive home from work, I was trying to understand why people seem to value discussions around solutions more than a deep understanding of the problem.

## The Temptation to Solution
Earlier in my career, I hesitated to speak up in meetings. Initially, I felt that if I asked questions, people would assume I didn't understand. Now, I tend to ask a lot of questions even when I'm confident I already know the answer. I do this because it helps me align my expectations with those I am speaking to without forcing my assumptions on them. Having felt from both perspectives, it's reasonable to think that people jump to solutions to show they understand the problem, are actively contributing, and are adding value to the conversation. It's important to balance eagerness with a deep understanding of problems.

## Valuing Speed Over Depth
The eagerness to find solutions may stem from the tendency organizations have to place emphasis on speed in decision-making. You've heard the old adage a million times: "time is money." I've seen "speed to market" in matrices that explain business value.

A co-worker and I often talk about "speed," and she always reminds me "that if you want work done quickly, then it will be poorly done or very expensive." In most cases, the outcome is poorly done work. Focusing on "speed to market," how can we add business value right now in the discovery process leads to solutions that may not be sustainably built for the future needs of the organization. In turn, you will have neglected in-depth comprehension in the pursuit of efficiency. This is where it becomes critical to understand what the future need is.

## A Real World Example
I have a customer looking to build an enterprise reporting environment. I recently mentioned  to the product owner that we need to understand the complexity of their reporting needs in the short and long term.

In discovery, a flat file solution was proposed. This solution will provide faster speed to market for simple reporting needs but will have limited scalability and support smaller datasets. On the other hand, a relational database will have a longer speed to market but will reduce redundancy, provide support for more complex reporting, is scalable, and structured.

Understanding the reporting requirements for each workstream that will use the enterprise reporting environment and the expected deliverables for each will help in making this decision. When I look at the data requested by the customer, there are already many concepts flattened into one file. Seeing as I expect the list of concepts to get larger as workstreams will require additional information, I am emphasizing that whatever strategy we choose needs to support the immediate and future organizational development.

## Building for the Future
Solutions that endure over time provide a better customer experience and likely end up saving the organization money in the long term. Constantly rebuilding data environments is expensive and time-consuming. We need to stress the importance of investing in a thorough understanding of problems for building scalable, adaptable solutions. How can organizations reward employees for their contributions to problem understanding rather than their solutions to ill-defined problems?
