# :wave: Hi, I'm Frank
I'm a data professional, managing, analyzing, interpreting, and extracting insights from dataâ€”the lens through which I view the world. Professionally, I've worked in education, healthcare, utilities, and banking. Personally, I enjoy traveling and personal finance, especially when able to leverage data to optimize both.
